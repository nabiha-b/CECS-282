This purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of pointers and structures.

It creates a student structure with the following fields: Name, Student ID, grade, birthday and Home Town.
It then creates an array of pointers to students of size 10 and populates them with students.

The contents of the array are neatly formatted and displayed with specific attribute-based columns. The user can choose to display a sorted list by a specific attribute of the student.
