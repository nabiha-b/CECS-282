This project uses Julian dates and uses it to help manipulate and manage dates. 

Formulas are used that convert a Gregorian date (example: 5/11/1959) to a Julian date which is the 
number of days that has elapsed since Nov 28, 4768 BC (or 11/28/-4768).

It uses pass-by-reference parameter passing to implement the JulianToGregorian function since 
3 parameters (month, day and year) have to be modified within the function and returned to the calling routine. 

The following concepts are used:
 Reference variables (AKA alias variables)
 Pass by reference
 Pass by value
 Creating and Abstract Data Type (a class with associated values and functions)
 Checking for valid objects at creation tim
